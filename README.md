The Ultimate Board Game

## Log

### 5-3 (8 hours):
Today we made a plan of approach, made a GitHub repository to store our program.
We also started working on the game. First, we made the board, then we made 2 players
and started working on the dice-roll logic. A dice is rolled for every player turn by
turn and their player is moved along the board accordingly. We also started working on
the multiple choice logic.
